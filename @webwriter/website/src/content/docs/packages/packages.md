# Packages
Packages are the publishing format for widgets, snippets, and themes (elements). Users can get developed elements by installing published packages via WebWriter.

## Technical View
Packages are npm packages exporting widgets (.js/.ts), snippets (.html), and themes (.css).

### Built-in Packages
The only difference between built-in and all other packages is that built-in packages come pre-installed with the editor. Otherwise, they implement the same interface. 

## Author/User View
To authors, packages are often synonymous with the main widget exported. They install/update/uninstall packages from WebWriter's package manager. To users, packages are no concern at all - they only interact with the widgets and themes bundled into explorables.
