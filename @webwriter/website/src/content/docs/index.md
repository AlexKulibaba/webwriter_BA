# Documentation
This documentation provides instructions on how to extend WebWriter. It is intended only for developers. If you just want to use WebWriter, try the *Get Started* button above.

WebWriter is a system for creating digital worksheets. It can be extended with widgets. Widgets are implemented as [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) and distributed as [NPM Packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules).

Widgets can be created with any library that outputs web components. A recommended choice is [Lit](https://lit.dev), which is a lightweight solution that builds on existing web standards as much as possible.
