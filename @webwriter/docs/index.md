> People currently think of text as information to be consumed. I want text to be used as an environment to think in. - [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/#!/ExplorableExplanations)

WebWriter is a tool for creating [explorables](https://explorabl.es/). Explorables mix text with multimedia and interactive content and can also be thought of as digital worksheets.

WebWriter is the product of a dissertation project at [RWTH Aachen University's Learning Technologies Research Group](https://learntech.rwth-aachen.de).
